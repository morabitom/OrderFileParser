Your task is to create a C# class (and subclasses) that can parse the provided text file into a class.
The file format is listed below.
Each order will have a single header records, a single address record, and one or more line items.
The only way to know which address line and which line items belong to an order is by their order in the file.
The C# class will be self contained meaning that it will contain both the data structure to hold the orders 
as well as have a method to parse the file.
You should likley have a class named Orders, This class will have a list of "order" objects and a parsefile method.
I have intentionally inserted a couple errors in the file such as an invalid amount as well as an invalid date.
I would like to see each order have a boolean for success/failure and a string to store any error messages.
Your app can be a windows Forms app or console app.
